Datasets and the index duration and query duration can be modified in the file "Exp-VII.sh"

Since the original file is too large to upload here, I upload 2 small files (test.txt and info.txt) here. File "test.txt" is the structure of the graph and "info.txt" contains the timestamps of nodes in the graph. I also changed the index duration from 1800 to 1, and query duration from 100 to 10.
