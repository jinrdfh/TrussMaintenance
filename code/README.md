# README #

This folder contains algorithms proposed in the paper "Efficient Star-based Truss Maintenance on Dynamic Graphs".

## File Organization ##

* **ballsIns/**: the code for truss incremental maintenance.
* **ballDel/**: the code for truss decremental maintenance.
* **index/**: the code for truss decomposition, also can build the index for our maintenance algorithms.
* **star/**: the code for dividing a graph into star motifs, which generates inputs for our maintenance algorithms.

## How to Use the Code? ##

* The compiling and running methods are in the corresponding directory.
* More examples can be found in the experiment scripts, located in "/reproduce-exp-result".
